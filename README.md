# JCoolprop
A Julia wrapper for CoolProp (http://www.coolprop.org)

This is not my work, and all the credit goes to the cool [CoolProp contributors](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/graphs/contributors). I only put this together to make things easier for a friend of mine.  

## Installation
```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/simulkade/CoolProp.jl.git")
Pkg.build("CoolProp") # to download the binaries 
```

## Note
The installer downloads libraries for other operating systems as well. I don't know how to fix it, right now.
