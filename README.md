# JCoolprop
A Julia wrapper for CoolProp (http://www.coolprop.org)

This is not my work, and all the credit goes to the cool [CoolProp contributors](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/graphs/contributors). I only put this together to make things easier for a friend of mine.  

## Installation
Pkg.clone("https"//github.com/simulkade/CoolProp.jl.git)

## Note
The installer downloads libraries for other operating systems as well. I don't know how to fix it, right now.
